React-Native Design #2: Styling RN with Props!

Shout out to Kuiper Collective! I’m learning the basics of React-Native from him as well as other sites like MDN and other sources for research!

So far, this is probably the most useful concept/practice that I’ve learned for React-Native styling. The idea is to create a block of code that takes in some sort of prop. We could then reuse this block of code through out the app! This tutorial will not cover how to recreate this pinterest app, but to explain how components and props work :)
